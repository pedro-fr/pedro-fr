### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pedro, a passionate student from Galicia (Spain) with a strong interest in bioinformatics and systems biology. I hope that this GitHub account will serve as a platform to present my projects, contributions and collaborations in the field of bioinformatics.

## About Me

- ðŸŽ“ I'm currently studying Biotechnology at USC (Universidade de Santiago de Compostela) and I plan to specialize further in bioinformatics with a master's degree  
- ðŸ’¼ I am enthusiastic about leveraging computational methods to solve biological problems.
- ðŸ’» My interests include transcriptomic analysis, data visualization and machine learning/AI applications in biology.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

**Differential expression analysis**: on several public transcriptomic datasets (expression microarrays and RNA-seq). This projecto involves using the resources of the CESGA supercomputing cluster for computationally demanding tasks such as sequence alignment and read counting. In addition, I am currently using the R environment in combination with various packages to perform differential expression analysis between different conditions (using tools such as DESeq2 and limma).
   
**Functional enrichment studies**: performed based on the identified genes, using enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG ontologies, as well as gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).

 **Data Visualization in Biology**: Creating interactive visualizations using R Markdown to communicate findings effectively.

## Academic Achievements
- I have completed basic courses in R programming (such as R Programming Fundamentals from Stanford Online), and I'm currently planning to enroll in programs more specific to bioinformatics, computational biology, and related fields.

## GitHub Student Developer Pack

I'm currently a student and I would like to apply for the GitHub Student Developer Pack to access tools and resources that can enhance my learning and development journey.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile! Feel free to connect and explore my (future) projects. Let's innovate and make meaningful contributions to the world of bioinformatics together! ðŸ§¬ðŸ”¬
